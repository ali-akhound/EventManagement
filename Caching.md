# 🎟️ Ticketing System Design & Caching Strategy

## System Design Overview

To handle thousands of concurrent users buying tickets on a high-traffic event platform, I propose a **Microservice Architecture** deployed in a cloud environment.

### Key Components:

- **Microservices:**
  - **Payment Service**
  - **Notification Service**
  - **Event Service**
  - **User & Authentication Service**

Each microservice is implemented as an independent application with its own database (SQL or NoSQL), enabling **database per service** design to improve modularity and scalability.

### Cloud Infrastructure:

- **Kubernetes** is used to orchestrate and manage microservice instances, providing:
  - Automated scaling based on load
  - Self-healing and fault tolerance
  - Rolling updates with zero downtime

- **API Gateway** layer acts as a single entry point that isolates microservices from direct external access, enhancing security and access control.

- **Message Queue (e.g., Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS, Kafka):**
  - Facilitates asynchronous communication between services
  - Ensures loose coupling and reliability
  - Supports event-driven workflows (e.g., ticket purchase triggers payment and notification)

- **Databases:**
  - Each service manages its own database instance (SQL or NoSQL), suited to its data model and access patterns.
  - Cloud-managed databases with automated scaling and backups.

## Fault Tolerance & Scalability

- Kubernetes orchestrates containerized microservices to **scale horizontally** based on demand.
- Each service can scale independently, e.g., Ticket Service scales during high traffic.
- Use of **circuit breakers**, **retry policies**, and **timeouts** prevents cascading failures.
- Services deployed across multiple availability zones to avoid single points of failure.
- Message queues ensure asynchronous processing and decouple service dependencies.

## Redis Caching Strategy

To improve performance and reduce load on the databases, Redis is used as a distributed caching layer with the following strategies:

- **Cache frequently requested data:**
  - Event details, seat availability, and other mostly read-heavy data.
- **Cache hot paths:**
  - Popular events or ticket availability to handle burst traffic.
- **Cache invalidation:**
  - Use TTL (time-to-live) on cached entries to ensure data freshness.
  - Cache updated or invalidated by event-driven triggers when underlying data changes.
- **Distributed Cache:**
  - Shared cache across all microservice instances to avoid cache duplication.
- **Use Redis Pub/Sub or Streams:**
  - Notify services to invalidate or update caches after data changes.
